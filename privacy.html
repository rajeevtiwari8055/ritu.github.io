<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and protected on Rajeev's professional portfolio website. By visiting, accessing, or interacting with the website, you agree to the practices described here. The website presents detailed sections including About Me, Skills, Education, Experience, Data Analytics projects, Certifications, Resume, GitHub repositories, and professional contact links. All information is intended to provide a comprehensive and educational showcase of professional achievements and learning efforts. Visitors are encouraged to review this policy carefully and use the website responsibly while respecting privacy principles. This Privacy Policy ensures transparency and builds trust between the website owner and visitors.
</p>

<h2>1. Purpose of This Website</h2>
<p>
The primary purpose of this website is to function as a professional portfolio and educational showcase. It provides a clear overview of Rajeev’s education, skills, work experience, project contributions, certifications, resume, and GitHub activities. Users can navigate through the site to understand his expertise, analytical and technical capabilities, and learning journey. The content is intended strictly for educational, professional development, and informational purposes. Visitors may use this information to inspire learning, explore project ideas, or understand how a portfolio can represent career growth. The website demonstrates the ongoing journey of professional development and learning.
</p>

<h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
<p>
This website does not automatically collect personal information through cookies, tracking scripts, analytics tools, or similar technologies. Any information provided by visitors is shared voluntarily, such as through email communication, Google Forms, WhatsApp messages, phone contact, or professional networking platforms. Visitors are responsible for providing only information they are comfortable sharing, and the website owner respects privacy by limiting collection to necessary professional or educational contexts. No automated systems are used to gather personal data, and visitors’ voluntary submissions are handled responsibly. This ensures a secure, transparent, and ethical approach to information management.
</p>

<h2>3. Use of Shared Information</h2>
<p>
Information shared voluntarily is used exclusively for professional, educational, or career-related purposes. This includes responding to queries, facilitating collaboration, discussing learning or project opportunities, or providing guidance. The website does not use any voluntarily provided information for marketing, promotional, or third-party analytics purposes. All shared information is treated with care, ensuring confidentiality and secure handling. Visitors are encouraged to engage responsibly and use the contact channels ethically. The focus remains on supporting professional networking, academic discussion, and learning-oriented communication.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Analytics & Learning Context</h2>
<p>
As the website owner actively learns and practices Data Analytics, some content may include dashboards, reports, sample datasets, and projects created solely for learning purposes. All datasets displayed are either dummy, publicly available, or personally generated for demonstration and practice. No visitor or external user data is analyzed or processed on this website. The content is intended for study, learning, and understanding analytical techniques, project workflows, and reporting practices. Visitors are encouraged to explore, replicate, and learn from these projects responsibly. The website serves as a safe, educational environment for showcasing analytical skills and ongoing learning.
</p>

<h2>5. External Links</h2>
<p>
The website may include links to external platforms, including LinkedIn profiles, GitHub repositories, certification portals, resume downloads, or Google Forms. Once a visitor accesses external websites, this Privacy Policy no longer governs the use or handling of information. Users should independently review the privacy policies, terms, and security measures of any external site. These links are provided solely for professional networking, educational references, or portfolio demonstration purposes. The website owner is not responsible for content, availability, or privacy practices on third-party platforms. Visitors are encouraged to exercise due diligence while exploring external resources.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>
Reasonable measures are in place to protect voluntarily shared information. However, since this website is a personal portfolio, absolute security cannot be guaranteed. Visitors should exercise caution when sharing personal or sensitive information. Any data submitted is handled with care, but users must acknowledge that no system is completely secure. The website owner aims to maintain a safe and professional environment, but visitors are ultimately responsible for their own information security. This transparency ensures users can make informed choices about sharing data online.
</p>

<h2>7. No Cookies & Tracking</h2>
<p>
This website does not utilize cookies, behavioral tracking scripts, advertising pixels, or third-party analytics tools. Visitors can navigate the website without concern for passive monitoring or automated data collection. The lack of tracking ensures that users’ activities on the site remain private and not stored or analyzed. This approach maintains privacy, respects user autonomy, and aligns with professional and educational objectives. Users are encouraged to explore content freely, knowing that personal browsing activity is not tracked.
</p>

<h2>8. Policy Updates</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in website content, learning objectives, professional growth, or portfolio enhancements. Visitors are encouraged to review the policy periodically. Continued use of the website signifies acceptance of any updates or revisions. Major changes may be indicated on the website or communicated through professional contact channels. Staying informed about these updates ensures transparency, trust, and alignment with evolving professional practices and learning methodologies.
</p>

<h2>9. Contact</h2>
<p>
Visitors may contact the website owner using the provided professional contact details, including email, phone, WhatsApp, or LinkedIn, for any questions, clarifications, or concerns related to privacy. All communication is intended for educational, professional, or career-related purposes. Responsible, respectful, and professional interaction is expected from all users. The website owner is committed to addressing queries promptly while maintaining a secure and professional online environment. Users are encouraged to reach out respectfully and with clear intent.
